                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate

序言

GNU Affero 通用公共许可证是一个自由的、允许复制的软件和其他类型作品的许可，在网络服务器软件的情况下，它是专门为确保与社区合作而设计。

大多数软件和其他实用作品的许可都是为了剥夺您分享和改变作品的自由。相比之下，我们的通用公共许可证的目的是保证您分享和改变一个程序的所有版本的自由--确保它对所有用户都是自由软件。

当我们谈论自由软件时，我们指的是自由，而不是价格。我们的通用公共许可证的设计是为了确保您有分发自由软件副本的自由（如果您愿意，还可以收费），您可以收到源代码，或者如果您想得到它，您可以改变软件或在新的自由程序中使用它的片段，而且您知道您可以做这些事情。

使用我们通用公共许可证的开发者通过两个步骤保护您的权利。(1)主张软件的版权，(2)向您提供本许可证，允许您合法地复制、分发和/或修改该软件。

捍卫所有用户自由的一个次要好处是，如果程序的替代版本得到广泛使用，就可以供其他开发者使用。许多自由软件的开发者对由此产生的合作感到振奋和鼓舞。然而，在网络服务器上使用的软件，这种结果可能无法实现。GNU通用公共许可证允许制作一个修改过的版本，让公众在服务器上访问它，而不需要向公众发布其源代码。

GNU Affero通用公共许可证是专门设计来确保在这种情况下，修改后的源代码可以被社区使用。它要求网络服务器的运营商向该服务器的用户提供运行在那里的修改版本的源代码。因此，在一个可公开访问的服务器上公开使用一个修改过的版本，使公众能够获得修改过的版本的源代码。

一个较早的许可证，称为Affero通用公共许可证，由Affero发布，旨在实现类似目标。这是一个不同的许可证，不是Affero GPL的一个版本，但Affero已经发布了Affero GPL的一个新版本，允许在这个许可证下重新许可。

关于复制、分发和修改的确切条款和条件如下。
条款与条件
0. 定义.

"本许可证 "是指GNU Affero通用公共许可证的第三版。
"版权 "也指适用于其他类型作品的类似版权的法律，如半导体掩模。

"本程序 "是指在本许可证下许可的任何有版权的作品。每个被许可人都被称呼为 "您"。"被许可人 "和 "接受者 "可以是个人或组织。

"修改 "作品是指以需要版权许可的方式复制或改编该作品的全部或部分内容，而不是制作一个完全的副本。由此产生的作品被称为早期作品的 "修改版 "或 "基于 "早期作品的作品。
一个 "涵盖的作品 "是指未经修改的程序或基于该程序的作品。

"传播 "作品是指在未经许可的情况下，对作品做任何事情，使您在适用的版权法下承担直接或间接的侵权责任，但在计算机上执行或修改私人副本除外。传播包括复制、分发（无论是否修改）、向公众提供，在一些国家还包括其他活动。
传播 "作品是指使其他各方能够制作或接受副本的任何一种传播。仅仅是通过计算机网络与用户互动，而没有转让副本，并不是传播。

交互式用户界面显示 "适当的法律声明 "的程度是，它包括一个方便和显眼的功能，(1)显示适当的版权声明，(2)告诉用户该作品没有保证（除了提供保证的范围），被许可人可以根据本许可传达该作品，以及如何查看本许可证的副本。如果界面呈现的是一个用户命令或选项的列表，如菜单，那么列表中的突出项目就符合这一标准。
1. 源代码.

作品的 "源代码 "是指对作品进行修改的首选形式。"目标代码 "是指作品的任何非源码形式。

"标准接口 "是指由公认的标准机构定义的官方标准的接口，或者在为某一特定编程语言指定接口的情况下，指在使用该语言的开发者中广泛使用的接口。

可执行作品的 "系统库 "包括除作品整体以外的任何东西，这些东西(a)以正常的形式打包一个主要部件，但不是该主要部件的一部分，以及(b)仅用于使作品与该主要部件一起使用，或用于实现一个标准接口，该接口的实现已以源代码形式向公众提供。这里的 "主要部件 "是指可执行作品所运行的特定操作系统（如果有的话）的主要基本部件（内核、窗口系统等），或用于制作该作品的编译器，或用于运行该作品的目标代码解释器。

目标代码形式的作品的 "相应源代码 "是指生成、安装和（对于可执行作品）运行目标代码以及修改作品所需的所有源代码，包括控制这些活动的脚本。但是，它不包括作品的系统库，也不包括在执行这些活动时未经修改但不属于作品的通用工具或普遍可用的免费程序。例如，相应源包括与作品的源文件相关的接口定义文件，以及作品专门设计的共享库和动态链接的子程序的源代码，例如通过亲密的数据通信或控制流在这些子程序和作品的其他部分之间。

相应源不需要包括用户可以从相应源的其他部分自动重新生成的任何东西。

源代码形式的作品的相应源是指同一作品。
2. 基本权限.

本许可证授予的所有权利都是在程序的版权期限内授予的，并且在满足所述条件的情况下是不可撤消的。本许可证明确肯定了您对运行未经修改的程序的无限许可。只有在输出的内容构成了一个受保护的作品的情况下，运行受保护作品的输出才受本许可证的保护。本许可证承认您的合理使用权或版权法所规定的其他同等权利。

只要您的许可证仍然有效，可以无条件地制作、运行和传播您没有转达的涵盖作品。您可以将涵盖的作品传达给其他人，唯一的目的是让他们专门为您进行修改，或为您提供运行这些作品的设施，前提是您在传达所有您不控制版权的材料时遵守本许可证的条款。那些为您制作或运行所涉作品的人必须完全代表您，在您的指导和控制下，按照禁止他们在与您的关系之外制作您的版权材料的任何副本的条款来进行。

在任何其他情况下，仅在下述条件下允许转让。不允许转授权；第10条规定没有必要。
3. 从反规避法中保护用户的合法权利.

根据任何履行1996年12月20日通过的世界知识产权组织版权条约第11条规定的义务的适用法律，或禁止或限制规避此类措施的类似法律，任何涵盖的作品都不得被视为有效技术措施的一部分。

当您传达一个涵盖的作品时，您放弃任何禁止规避技术措施的法律权力，只要这种规避是通过对涵盖的作品行使本许可证下的权利而实现的，并且您否认有任何限制操作或修改作品的意图，以作为对作品的用户强制执行您或第三方禁止规避技术措施的法律权利的手段。
4. 传递逐字拷贝.

您可以在收到程序的源代码后，以任何媒介传递其逐字拷贝，但您必须在每份拷贝上醒目地、适当地发布适当的版权声明；保持所有说明本许可证和根据第7条添加的任何非许可条款适用于代码的声明完整无缺；保持所有关于没有任何保证的声明完整无缺；并将本许可证的拷贝与程序一起交给所有接收者。

您可以对每份拷贝收取任何费用，也可以不收取任何费用，您还可以提供有偿的支持或保修保护。
5. 传递修改后的源版本.

您可以根据第 4 节的条款，以源代码的形式传达基于本程序的作品，或根据本程序的修改而产生的作品，但您必须满足以下所有条件:

    a) 作品必须有醒目的声明，说明您修改了它，并给出相关的日期。
    b) 作品必须有醒目的声明，说明它是根据本许可证和根据第7条增加的条件发布的。这一要求修改了第4节中 "保持所有通知的完整性 "的要求。
    c) 您必须根据本许可证将整个作品作为一个整体许可给任何拥有其副本的人。因此，本许可证将与任何适用的第7条附加条款一起，适用于整个作品及其所有部分，无论它们是如何包装的。本许可证不允许以任何其他方式许可该作品，但如果您已经单独收到了这种许可，它也不会使这种许可失效。

如果一个受保护作品与其他单独和独立的作品的汇编，其性质不是受保护作品的延伸，并且没有与之结合以形成更大的程序，在存储或分发媒介的某一卷上，如果该汇编及其产生的版权没有被用来限制汇编用户的访问或法律权利，超出单个作品允许的范围，则被称为 "聚合"。将一个受保护的作品包含在一个总体中并不导致本许可证适用于总体的其他部分。
6. 传递非源形式.

您可以根据第4条和第5条的规定，以目标代码的形式传递被保护的作品，但您也必须根据本许可证的规定，以下列方式之一传递机器可读的相应源代码:

    a) 在实体产品（包括实体销售媒介）中传递目标代码，或体现在实体产品（包括实体销售媒介）中，同时将相应的源代码固定在通常用于软件交换的耐用实体媒介上。
    b) 在实物产品（包括实物销售媒介）中传递目标代码，或在实物产品（包括实物销售媒介）中体现目标代码，并附有一份至少三年有效的书面报价，只要您为该产品型号提供备件或客户支持，就一直有效。向任何拥有目标代码的人提供(1)本许可证所涵盖的产品中所有软件的相应源代码的拷贝，拷贝在通常用于软件交换的耐用物理介质上，其价格不超过贵方实际执行这一传递源代码的合理成本，或者(2)从网络服务器上免费获取相应的源代码拷贝。
    c) 将目标代码的单个副本与提供相应来源的书面提议的副本一起传送。只有在偶尔和非商业性的情况下，并且只有在您收到目标代码和这种提议的情况下，才允许这种选择，符合第6b款的规定。
    d) 通过提供从指定地点（免费或收费）获取目标代码，并以同样的方式通过同一地点提供相应的源码，而不再收费。您不需要要求接受者在复制目标代码的同时复制相应的源代码。如果复制目标代码的地方是一个网络服务器，对应源可以在另一个支持同等复制设施的服务器上（由您或第三方运营），只要您在目标代码旁边保持明确的指示，说明在哪里可以找到对应源。无论对应源在哪个服务器上，您都有义务确保在满足这些要求所需的时间内提供对应源。
    e) 使用点对点传输的方式传送目标代码，但您必须告知其他同行，根据第6d款，目标代码和作品的对应源正在免费提供给公众。

目标代码的可分离部分，其源代码作为系统库被排除在相应的源码之外，不需要包括在传达目标代码作品中。

用户产品 "是指(1) "消费品"，即通常用于个人、家庭或家居用途的任何有形个人财产，或(2)为纳入住宅而设计或出售的任何东西。在确定一个产品是否是消费品时，有疑问的情况应以有利于承保的方式解决。对于特定用户收到的特定产品，"通常使用 "是指该类产品的典型或常见用途，而不考虑特定用户的地位或特定用户实际使用或期望或预期使用该产品的方式。一个产品是消费类产品，无论该产品是否有大量的商业、工业或非消费类用途，除非这些用途是该产品的唯一重要使用方式。

用户产品的 "安装信息 "是指在该用户产品中从其对应源的修改版本安装和执行所涵盖作品的修改版本所需的任何方法、程序、授权密钥或其他信息。这些信息必须足以确保在任何情况下都不会仅仅因为进行了修改而阻止或干扰修改后的目标代码的继续运行。

如果您在用户产品中，或与用户产品一起，或专门在用户产品中使用，并作为交易的一部分，将用户产品的拥有权和使用权永久或固定地转让给接受者（无论交易如何定性），根据本条规定转让的对应源必须附有安装信息。但是，如果您或任何第三方都没有保留在用户产品上安装修改过的目标代码的能力（例如，作品已经安装在ROM中），则该要求不适用。

提供安装信息的要求不包括继续为被接受者修改或安装的作品或被修改或安装的用户产品提供支持服务、保证或更新的要求。当修改本身对网络的运行产生实质性的不利影响或违反了网络上的通信规则和协议时，可以拒绝访问网络。
根据本节规定，所传达的相应源码和所提供的安装信息必须是公开记录的格式（并以源代码的形式向公众提供实现），并且必须不需要特殊的密码或钥匙来解包、阅读或复制。
7. 附加条款.

"附加许可 "是对本许可条款的补充，对其中的一个或多个条件作出例外规定。适用于整个程序的附加许可应被视为包括在本许可证中，只要它们在适用法律下有效。如果附加许可只适用于本程序的一部分，则该部分可以根据这些许可单独使用，但整个程序仍受本许可证的管辖，而不考虑附加许可。

当您转送一份受保护作品的副本时，您可以选择从该副本或其任何部分中删除任何附加许可。(在某些情况下，当您修改作品时，附加许可可能被写成需要自己删除)。您可以在您添加到涵盖的作品中的材料上放置额外的许可，对于这些材料，您有或可以给予适当的版权许可。

尽管本许可证有任何其他规定，对于您添加到受保护作品中的材料，您可以（如果得到该材料的版权持有人的授权）用以下条款补充本许可证的条款:

    a) 以不同于本许可证第15条和第16条的条款声明保证或限制责任；或
    b) 要求在该材料或包含该材料的作品所显示的适当法律声明中保留特定的合理法律声明或作者归属；或
    c) 禁止歪曲该材料的来源，或要求以合理的方式将该材料的修改版本标记为与原始版本不同；或
    d) 限制为宣传目的使用该材料的许可人或作者的姓名；或
    e) 拒绝根据商标法授予使用某些商号、商标或服务标志的权利；或
    f) 要求将材料（或材料的修改版本）转交给接受者的任何人对这些合同假设直接加在这些许可人和作者身上的任何责任进行赔偿。

所有其他非许可性的附加条款都被视为第10条意义上的 "进一步限制"。如果您收到的程序或其任何部分包含一个通知，说明它受本许可证的管辖，同时还有一个属于进一步限制的条款，您可以删除该条款。如果许可文件包含进一步的限制，但允许根据本许可证进行再许可或转让，您可以在受保护的作品中添加受该许可文件条款管辖的材料，但进一步的限制在这种再许可或转让中不存在。

如果您按照本节的规定向受保护的作品添加条款，您必须在相关的源文件中声明适用于这些文件的附加条款，或者说明在哪里可以找到适用条款。

额外的条款，不管是允许的还是非允许的，都可以以单独的书面许可的形式说明，或者作为例外情况说明；上述要求适用于任何一种方式。
8. 终止.

除本许可证明确规定的情况外，您不得传播或修改覆盖作品。任何以其他方式传播或修改作品的尝试都是无效的，并将自动终止您在本许可下的权利（包括根据第11节第三段授予的任何专利许可）。

然而，如果您停止所有违反本许可的行为，那么您从某一特定版权人处获得的许可将被恢复（a）暂时性的，除非并直到版权人明确并最终终止您的许可，以及（b）永久性的，如果版权人未能在停止后的60天内通过某种合理的方式通知您侵权行为。

此外，如果版权持有人以某种合理的方式通知您侵权行为，这是您第一次收到该版权持有人违反本许可证的通知（针对任何作品），并且您在收到通知后30天内纠正了侵权行为，那么您从某一版权持有人获得的许可证将被永久恢复。

终止您在本节下的权利并不终止那些根据本许可证从您那里获得副本或权利的各方的许可。如果您的权利已经被终止，而且没有永久恢复，您就没有资格根据第10条获得相同材料的新许可。
9. 拥有副本不需要接受.

您不需要为了接收或运行程序的副本而接受本许可证。仅仅由于使用点对点传输来接收拷贝而发生的被保护作品的辅助传播，也同样不需要接受。然而，除了本许可证之外，没有任何其他东西允许您传播或修改任何受保护的作品。如果您不接受本许可证，这些行为就侵犯了版权。因此，通过修改或传播涵盖的作品，您表明您接受本许可证，可以这样做。
10. 下游接受者的自动许可.

每当您传递一个涵盖的作品时，接收者会自动从原始许可人那里得到一个许可证，在遵守本许可证的前提下，运行、修改和传播该作品。您不负责执行第三方对本许可证的遵守。

实体交易 "是指转让一个组织的控制权，或一个组织的大部分资产，或拆分一个组织，或合并组织的交易。如果实体交易导致覆盖作品的传播，那么收到作品副本的每一个交易方也会收到该方的权益前身根据前段规定所拥有或可以给予的任何作品许可，以及从权益前身处获得作品对应源的拥有权，如果权益前身拥有或通过合理努力可以获得。

您不得对行使本许可证下授予或确认的权利施加任何进一步的限制。例如，您不得对行使本许可证所授予的权利征收许可费、特许权使用费或其他费用，也不得提起诉讼（包括诉讼中的交叉索赔或反索赔），指控制作、使用、销售、提供销售或进口本程序或其任何部分侵犯了任何专利权利。
11. 专利.

贡献者 "是指授权根据本许可证使用本程序或本程序所基于的作品的版权持有人。这样授权的作品被称为贡献者的 "贡献者版本"。

贡献者的 "基本专利权利要求 "是指贡献者拥有或控制的所有专利权利要求，不管是已经获得的还是以后获得的，这些专利权利要求将被本许可证允许的某种方式所侵犯，即制作、使用或销售其贡献者版本，但不包括仅因进一步修改贡献者版本而被侵犯的权利要求。就本定义而言，"控制 "包括以符合本许可证要求的方式授予专利分许可的权利。

每个贡献者根据贡献者的基本专利权利要求，授予您非独占性的、全球性的、免版税的专利许可，以制造、使用、销售、提供销售、进口和以其他方式运行、修改和传播其贡献者版本的内容。

在以下三段中，"专利许可 "是指不实施专利的任何明示协议或承诺，无论其名称如何（例如，明确允许实施专利或不起诉专利侵权的约定）。向一方 "授予 "这种专利许可意味着作出这种协议或承诺，不对该方实施专利。

如果您在知情的情况下，依靠专利许可传递了一个涵盖的作品，而该作品的相应来源并没有通过公开的网络服务器或其他容易获得的方式，供任何人根据本许可证的条款免费复制，那么您必须(1)使相应来源可以获得，或者(2)安排剥夺自己对该特定作品的专利许可利益，或者(3)以符合本许可证要求的方式，安排将专利许可扩展到下游接受者。"明知故犯 "是指您实际知道，如果没有专利许可，您在某个国家传递所涉作品，或者您的接受者在某个国家使用所涉作品，将侵犯您有理由相信在该国有效的一项或多项可识别专利。

如果根据一项交易或安排或与之相关，您转让或通过促成转让传播被保护作品，并向接受被保护作品的某些当事方授予专利许可，授权他们使用、传播、修改或转让被保护作品的特定副本，那么您授予的专利许可将自动扩展到被保护作品和基于该作品的所有接受者。

如果专利许可不包括在其覆盖范围内，禁止行使或以不行使本许可具体授予的一项或多项权利为条件，则为 "歧视性的"。如果您是与从事软件分销业务的第三方达成的安排的一方，根据该安排，您根据您传递作品的活动范围向第三方付款，并且根据该安排，第三方向任何将从您那里获得所涉作品的一方授予，则您不得传递所涉作品。歧视性的专利许可：(a)与您传递的作品的副本（或由这些副本制作的副本）有关，或(b)主要为包含该作品的特定产品或汇编并与之有关，除非您在2007年3月28日之前达成该安排，或授予该专利许可。

本许可证中的任何内容都不应被解释为排除或限制任何隐含的许可或其他对侵权的抗辩，根据适用的专利法，您可能会有这样的机会。
12. 不放弃他人的自由.

如果强加给您的条件（无论是通过法院命令、协议或其他方式）与本许可证的条件相抵触，它们并不能免除您对本许可条件的遵守。如果您不能在转让作品时同时满足您在本许可证下的义务和任何其他相关的义务，那么作为结果，您可以不转让它。例如，如果您同意的条款规定，您有义务向接受您传送程序的人收取版税，那么您要同时满足这些条款和本许可证的要求，唯一的办法就是完全不传送该程序。
13. 远程网络交互；与GNU通用公共许可证一起使用.

尽管本许可证有任何其他规定，如果您修改本程序，您的修改版本必须在显著位置向所有通过计算机网络远程与本程序互动的用户（如果您的版本支持这种互动）提供机会，通过一些标准或习惯的促进软件复制的方式，从网络服务器上免费提供相应的源码。该相应源码应包括根据下段规定纳入GNU通用公共许可证第3版的任何作品的相应源码。

尽管本许可证有任何其他规定，您有权利将任何受保护的作品与在GNU通用公共许可证第3版下许可证的作品链接或结合成一个单一的组合作品，并传递由此产生的作品。本许可证的条款将继续适用于受保护作品的部分，但与之结合的作品将继续受GNU通用公共许可证第3版的管辖。
14. 本许可证的修订版.

自由软件基金会可能会不时地发布GNU Affero通用公共许可证的修订版和/或新版本。这些新版本在精神上与目前的版本相似，但在细节上可能有所不同，以解决新的问题或关切。

每个版本都有一个区分的版本号。如果本程序指定某个编号的 GNU Affero 通用公共许可证 "或任何后来的版本 "适用于它，您可以选择遵守该编号的版本或自由软件基金会发布的任何后来的版本的条款和条件。如果本程序没有指定 GNU Affero 通用公共许可证的版本号，您可以选择自由软件基金会发布的任何版本。
如果本计划规定代理人可以决定未来可以使用哪个版本的 GNU Affero 通用公共许可证，那么该代理人对某个版本的公开接受声明将永久授权您为本计划选择该版本。

以后的许可证版本可能会给您额外的或不同的权限。但是，任何作者或版权持有人都不会因为您选择了后来的版本而承担额外的义务。
15. 免责声明.

在适用法律允许的范围内，对该程序没有任何保证。除非另有书面说明，否则版权持有人和/或其他各方 "按原样 "提供该程序，不提供任何明示或暗示的保证，包括但不限于对适销性和特定用途的适用性的暗示保证。关于程序的质量和性能的全部风险由您承担。如果该程序被证明有缺陷，您将承担所有必要的服务、修理或纠正的费用。
16. 赔偿责任的限制.

在任何情况下，除非适用法律要求或书面同意，任何版权持有人或任何其他按上述规定修改和/或传递程序的当事人都不对您的损害负责，包括因使用或无法使用本程序而引起的任何一般的、特殊的、偶然的或间接的损害（包括但不限于数据丢失或数据不准确或您或第三方遭受的损失或本程序无法与任何其他程序一起运行），即使该持有人或其他当事人已被告知这种损害的可能性。
17. 第15条和第16条的解释.

如果以上规定的免责声明和责任限制不能根据其条款在当地产生法律效力，审查法院应适用最接近于绝对放弃与本程序有关的所有民事责任的当地法律，除非在收取费用的本程序副本上附有保证或责任承担。

以上是条款和条件
如何将这些条款应用于您的新程序

如果您开发了一个新的程序，并希望它对公众有最大的用处，实现这一目标的最好方法是使它成为自由软件，每个人都可以在这些条款下重新发布和修改。

要做到这一点，请在程序中附上以下通知。最安全的做法是把它们附在每个源文件的开头，以最有效地说明排除担保的情况；每个文件至少要有 "版权 "一行和一个指向完整通知的指针。
